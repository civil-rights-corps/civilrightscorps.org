                Civil Rights Corps is a new non-profit organization dedicated to challenging systemic injustices in the American criminal legal system.  The organization works with criminal defendants, inmates, family members, communities, formerly incarcerated people, advocates, judges, and government officials to end human caging and to create a legal system that promotes equality and human flourishing.  Civil Rights Corps engages in advocacy and public education and brings innovative, systemic civil rights litigation to help resensitize the legal system and our culture to the injustices and brutality that characterize the contemporary American criminal system.
